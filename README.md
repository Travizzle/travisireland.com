# My Personal Website

This is my CSS project using the [Jekyll static site generator](https://www.jekyllrb.com), for the CSS portion of the excellent tutorial series [Learn Enough to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com). It features a nascent photo gallery that will be both the culmination of the Javascript tutorial and the beginning of my photo hoarding habit, as well as a blog that I'm ambivalent about using. For now this is my personal website as on my own it would take me forever to make something that looks this good. It can be reached by visiting [travisireland.com](https://www.travisireland.com).

If for some reason you want to copy this website you need to set up a Ruby programming language development environment, a la these (possibly out-dated) instructions:

[Learn Enough Dev Environment to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/dev-environment-tutorial)

After that you need to download the Jekyll static site generator via the Ruby Bundler software manager (and maybe not-so-obviously download the Ruby Bundler itself first).

I don't guarantee that anything will work even if you do everything to the letter, but this project needs Jekyll and probably Jekyll through Ruby Bundler, to function at all, let alone function properly.

I understand very little of what I did to set this up, but I do understand how to follow instructions and persist when those instructions turn out to be wrong.

Either be persistent, or be smart enough to understand that trying to learn how this works by trying to reverse-engineer someone else's project is orders of magnitude harder than just reading the documentation and experimenting.
