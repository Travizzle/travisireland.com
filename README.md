# My Personal Website

This is my CSS project using the [Jekyll static site generator](https://www.jekyllrb.com), for the CSS portion of the excellent tutorial series [Learn Enough to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com). It features a nascent photo gallery that will be both the culmination of the Javascript tutorial and the beginning of my photo hoarding habit, as well as a blog that I'm ambivalent about using. For now this is my personal website as on my own it would take me forever to make something that looks this good. It can be reached by visiting [travisireland.com](https://www.travisireland.com).
