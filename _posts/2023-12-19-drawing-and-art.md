This is an entry concerned with the last several attempts at art which I do not engage in regularly and likely wouldn't engage in if it wasn't in a group setting. It is also an attempt to take pictures with my tablet and transfer the files to my computer and use those images on my site instead of the free images on [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com)... which may actually qualify as another form of art.

These are the first two drawings, based on Halloween:

The first is a puppy witch.

The second is a cat sitting on a pumpkin.
