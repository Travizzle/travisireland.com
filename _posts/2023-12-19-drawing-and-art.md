This is an entry about my last several attempts at art which I do not engage in regularly and likely wouldn't engage in if it wasn't in a group setting. It is also an attempt to take pictures with my tablet and transfer the files to my computer and use those images on my site instead of the free images on [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com)... which may actually qualify as an art form in and of itself.

These are the first two drawings, based around animals and Halloween. The first is a puppy dressed as a witch and the second is a cat sitting on a pumpkin.

The next two drawings are from the next session, and they happen to be based around both Halloween and food; a cup of pumpkin spice hot chocolate, and a zombie ice cream cone.

The last two sessions produced a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGS2KBRbaXo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hand turkey</a> and an assortment of <a href="https://volumeone.org/articles/2020/12/11/268592-wondering-how-to-make-paper-snowflakes-look-no" rel="noopener" target="_blank">snowflakes</a>. I like the video for the hand turkeys because it taught me a method I haven't thought of before but I threw out the turkeys I made, so I have none to showcase.

<div class="snowflakes">
    <div class="paper-snowflakes">
        <img src="/images/art/snowflake-2.jpg" alt="paper snowflake">
        <img src="/images/art/hand-snowflake.jpg" alt="hand turkey snowflake">
    </div>
    <div class="paper-snowflakes">
        <img src="/images/art/snowflake-3.jpg" alt="paper snowflake">
        <img src="/images/art/snowflake-4.jpg" alt="paper snowflake">
    </div>
</div>

One snowflake was supposed to be a combo of a hand turkey and a snowflake but evidently I didn't know what I was doing. The six-sided snowflake is the one that the link teaches you to make.
