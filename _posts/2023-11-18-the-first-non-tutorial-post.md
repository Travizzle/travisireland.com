Now I have the blog finished. The comment section is operational and the posts look adequately styled. I still can't quite figure out how to download a picture into my project images folder using the command line.

The next part of the tutorial is using mobile media queries so that the site styles change depending on what screen size the site is being viewed on. Responsive web design I think it's called. That's tomorrow's problem that I'll start after taking notes for this section of the blog chapter.

Actually it looks like my next problem is either figuring out how to use flexbox to make the post fill a page, or writing longer posts so that the the footer and comment section don't bleed into the post content... maybe just a blog post per week is the way to go so that a post will take up more space than the recent post section. More problems to be solved.
